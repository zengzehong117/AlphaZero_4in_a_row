## AlphaZero_4in_a_row
This is an implementation of the AlphaZero algorithm for playing the simple board game 4 in a row.

### Getting Started
To play with provided models, run the following script from the directory:  
```
python human_play.py  
```
You may modify human_play.py to try different provided models or the pure MCTS.

To train the AI model, directly run:   
```
